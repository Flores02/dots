`Klavaro` is a GTK [touch typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing) trainer. It is really nice to just sit and listen to a pod while the fingers flow. My average [WPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_per_minute) is around **55** at the moment. But I slowly improve. 

I believe touch typing is very important to master if you want to become a good programmer.

If you never have given touch typing a thought, i really recommend you read [Programming's Dirtiest Little Secret](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.se/2008/09/programmings-dirtiest-little-secret.html) by Steve Yegge.
