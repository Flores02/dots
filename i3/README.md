I have a script called [i3merge] that i use to merge the config files in this directory (and a file that is named theme, generated by [mondo], to one ~/.config/i3/config file.

- base, contains most i3 settings
- layout-\* contains settings specific to a specific setup, (such as different monitor layout.)
  
the layout is determined by the value of the custom environment variable `XLAYOUT`. By default `XLAYOUT` is "mobile".

In my [bashrc], i have added a check for keyboard input, if <kbd>1</kbd> is entered during this check, `XLAYOUT` will be set to 'vind'.

I have written [articles], recorded [videos] and written a lot of custom scripts, found in the [i3ass] and [i3add] repos, for **i3**.
