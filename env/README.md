I like to have the short lowercase names on my folders for easier navigation through from the terminal and it also looks cool.

I have also written a guide, and recorded a video on how to achieve the [Perfect Folder](https://budrich.github.io/blog/perfect_folders) structure. 

These are the environment variables that are specific to my i3 session. I have found that sourcing it in [.xinitrc](https://budrich.github.io/dots/xinit) is the best, since some of the settings are dependent on xorg running, so itâ€™s not perfect to export the variables in [.bashrc](https://budrich.github.io/dots/bash/bashrc).
