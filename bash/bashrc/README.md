The `read -rsn1 -t2 input` waits two seconds for a key-press before it starts **X** and **i3**. If I press `1` I stay in the wonderful tty environment. If I press `2` or wait 2 seconds, **i3** starts. 

I have found this method much more convenient then a normal DM, where you have to change DE from some, very easily forgotten, menu. Often resulting in me logging in to the wrong DE...

I also source all files in `~/.bash/` . I just upgraded Mint and it was kind enough to overwrite my `.bashrc`, that made me decide to have it as minimal as possible so I can easily restore it if something similar happens.

I don't care so much about GNU/Linux-distros and I have not had any problems with Mint till this happened. But it is so poor design to overwrite `.bashrc` that I'm seriously thinking on hopping just because of that.* 

But maybe other distros behave similar...

\* *edit: i now run arch linux, and before that PeppermintOS*
