This is the power of the bash shell, you can write small functions to make using the shell easier. 

**lb**  
I found this one on the [LinuxBBQ forums](https://linuxbbq.org/bbs/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=2076) it adds the last command to a logfile. Very handy.

**adda**  
Adds a new permanent alias. Example:   
`adda dwn cd ~/Downloads`  
this will add, `alias dwn='~/Downloads'` to [~/.bash/alias](https://github.com/budRich/dots/tree/master/bash/alias) and reloads [~/.bashrc](https://github.com/budRich/dots/tree/master/bashrc) so you can use the alias immediately. 

**apti/gemi/pipi**  
install packages and log package name.

**mcd**  
Classic function that creates a folder and cd into it.
