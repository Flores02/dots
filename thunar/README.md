This file contains `thunars` keybindings (*or accelerators, as keybindings is called in GTK*). The file is autogenerated, so any formatting to the file is pointless. To modify an existing keybinding, one just remove the `;` and change the last string of the line to the desired keycombination. 

This file (`~/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/thunar.xml`) contains [hidden settings](https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/hidden-settings) for **thunar**. By altering this file before launching an instance of **thunar**, one can manipulate the appearance (*sort, icon-size e.t.c*) of the thunar window.

This file contains user defined actions that can be used within `thunar`. One can use the **unique-id** to bind actions to hotkeys in [~/.config/Thunar/accels.scm](https://budrich.github.io/dots/thunar/accels).
