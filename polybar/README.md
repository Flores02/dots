Polybar is a great statusbar that works well with i3 and other window managers, this is my config file. It uses some custom scripts to display some information.

In the screenshot above you can see polybar at the top of the screen. I use [i3fyra](https://budrich.github.io/i3ass/i3fyra) to achieve the layout. Container A(vivaldi/wg) and B(irssi)  are tabbed and container C is horizontally split with three urxvt instances.
