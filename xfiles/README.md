 
The X-files, variables are set defined by [mondo](https://budrich.github.io/mondo) in [mondo/mondo-theme](https://budrich.github.io/dots/mondo/mondo-theme).  

By setting `Xcursor.theme` in `~/.Xresources` I ensure to have the right mouse cursor theme in terminal applications.  

`rofi` will drop `Xresources` support soon and I have removed all rofi theming from the xfiles in favor of rofi's own theme engine. But i keep `rofi.theme` since it sets a default theme for my menus.  

I guess the most interesting xfile is [urxvt](https://budrich.github.io/dots/xfiles/urxvt) .
